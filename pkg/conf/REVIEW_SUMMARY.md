# PR Review Summary for PR #4

This PR introduces significant improvements in modularity, configuration management, and error code handling. However, there are some issues that must be addressed before merging:

## Required Changes
1. **Incomplete Implementation:**
   - `FileConfigReader.ReadConfig()` in `pkg/conf/reader/FileConfigReader.go` is currently a stub and must be implemented to actually read configuration files.
2. **Naming Consistency:**
   - The variable `appConfigurtion` in `pkg/conf/reader/reader.go` is a typo and should be corrected to `appConfiguration` everywhere.
3. **Remove Dead Code:**
   - Please remove commented-out code blocks for better readability and maintainability.
4. **Error Handling:**
   - Ensure all error returns are handled and logged, especially in configuration loading and merging.
5. **Test Coverage:**
   - Ensure all new logic, especially configuration merging and reading, is covered by tests.

Please address these issues and re-run all tests. Once resolved, this PR will be a strong improvement to the codebase. If you need clarification on any point, let me know!
